# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

##  Task Objective
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to extract insights, uncover patterns, detect relationships, and identify key factors affecting passenger survival.

##  Dataset Information
- **Dataset Name**: Titanic-Dataset.csv
- **Source**: [Kaggle Titanic Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
- **Rows**: 891
- **Columns**: 12
- **Target Variable**: Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python 
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab
- GitHub

##  EDA Highlights
- Checked for missing values and data types.
- Univariate Analysis: Age distribution, gender distribution, class distribution.
- Bivariate Analysis: Survival analysis by gender, age, class.
- Created professional visualizations (Histograms, Barplots, KDE plots, Heatmap, Pairplots).
- Observed important relationships and trends influencing survival.

##  Key Findings
- Young adults (20â€“40 years) were the majority passengers.
- Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males.
- 1st class passengers had the highest survival rate.
- Higher Fare correlated with a higher chance of survival.
- 3rd class passengers had the lowest survival probability.

##  Files Included
- `Titanic-Dataset.csv` - Dataset file
- `Titanic_EDA.ipynb` - Colab notebook with full EDA code
- `Titanic_EDA_Report.pdf` - PDF report with charts and observations
- `README.md` - This file

##  How to Run
1. Upload `Titanic-Dataset.csv` to your Colab environment.
2. Open and run the `Titanic_EDA.ipynb` notebook step-by-step.
3. View charts and read the observations below each plot.
4. Review the final summary for insights.

##  Conclusion
This EDA exercise gave insights into how age, gender, passenger class, and fare impacted survival on the Titanic.  
It also demonstrated the importance of visualization and data exploration before any predictive modeling.
